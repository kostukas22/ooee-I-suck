  <h1>The quest for Boba</h1>
  <img style= "width: 500px" src = "boba.jpeg"
  <p>One time not so long ago... I was at a hackathon. In the middle of it they had a thing where if you built a website you could get boba. You needed to theme your website around a side quest you have done, but I could not think of anything.</p>
  <h2> The solution</h2>
  <p> I realised the act of making a website about a side quest was a side quest its self. Because of this realization I decided to write about the process of writing about this.</p>
